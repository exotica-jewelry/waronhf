name: Run accessibility (a11y) tests
# This action uses both axe (axe-core/cli) and pa11y to check for accessibility
# errors. This action will fail when errors are found. If you'd rather it only
# warn you about accessibility issues but not fail when issues are found, you
# could use axe's cli instead:
# https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli
