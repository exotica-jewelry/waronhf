Sass stylesheets (in SCSS format) are loaded in alphabetical order. Prefix the
stylesheets with letters to control this order.

The Sass files are then transpiled to a generated CSS file in this folder. Don't
edit this CSS file, as it will be overwritten on the next change.

If you're not familiar with Sass, in its SCSS format it is a superset of CSS,
meaning you can use any valid CSS within the Sass files even if you don't want
to learn anything about Sass. For more information, see
https://sass-lang.com/documentation
